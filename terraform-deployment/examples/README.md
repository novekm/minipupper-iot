# Terraform Examples Documentation
There are several examples you can leverage to get started with deployment. Some parameters are optional as there are defaults set based on the intended use of the workshop.
### Instructions
1. Navigate to the directory for one of the examples
2. Copy the content of the the related **`main.tf`** file and paste into YOUR **`main.tf`** file.

5. Initialize Terraform **`terraform init`**
6. Plan Terraform deployment **`terraform plan`**
7. Apply Terraform plan **`terraform apply`**

# Basic Deployment
This deploys all necessities with the exception of the AWS Amplify App. The app will however still be available locally. To start the dev server, navigate to 'bc-web-app' run 'npm i' then 'npm run dev' to start the dev server. To deploy the full AWS Amplify App, see either the github-deployment or gitlab-deployment folders
