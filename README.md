This workshop is a guided example of how you can leverage AWS IoT Core, AWS Amplify, Terraform, and robotics to improve worker safety. The robots used in this workshop are called Mini Pupper 2. If you're not familiar with **[Mini Pupper 2](hhttps://mangdang.store/products/mini-pupper-open-source-ros-robot-dog-kit)**, it is an open-source robotic operating system. While Mini Pupper 2 comes with support for control with a game controller, we extended upon it's core functionality and have created a web and mobile app that you can use to issue commands through AWS for added functionality. We have also added support for a companion Air Quality Sensor (M5StickCPlus) where the robots will perform actions in response to detection of simulated toxins.

We have connected Mini Pupper 2 to **[AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/)** and have created a serverless full stack **[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)** App to control not just one robot, but ***an entire fleet of robots***. To provide a streamlined and repeatable deployment, we are leveraging **[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). If you are not too familiar with Terraform, don't worry - we have created a custom Terraform module to abstract away most of the infrastructure creation down to a few lines of code. For those more experienced with Terraform, feel free to customize and add on to this solution, we are making it completely open-source.

To see Mini Pupper 2 in action, check out **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeT10vdBSJM&t=1s)**.

 For getting started quickly, check out some of our provided **[code examples](https://github.com/novekm/iot-robopupper/tree/main/terraform-deployment/examples)**.
